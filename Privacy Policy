**** Privacy Policy ****

This is the privacy policy for the TikFinder app made by Emanuele Delirio.

Information Collection and Use:
The app does not require you to provide with personally identifiable information in order to be used. I do not use, transfer or share any personal data. 
The only information to be provided is the Instagram username that you wish to promote. The username is stored
on Google Firebase in order to be used inside the app. 
Any text added by you by using this app will be retained on your device and it will be stored on Google Firebase.
The text added by you should never include personal data, sensitive information, passwords, card numbers or 
any other content that could identify you or someone else. 
Only insert content related to the functionalities of this app (i.e. a description of your account).
The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you or your device.
The app includes AdMob in order to show personalized Ad banners. In particular, "Google can use the advertisment ID 
of the device where the Ad banner is shown, in order to generate interests and demographic data. 
The interests, the demographic data and other data can be used by Google to publish banner targeted for the user". 

Remove your data and content:
In order to delete permanently the information that you used inside the app (username and description), you can send
an email to emavisuals@gmail.com specifying the username to remove.
