I (Emanuele Delirio) built the TikFinder app (the app) as a free app. This app is provided by me at no cost and is intended for use as is.

Please read TikTok guidelines to understand how to properly follow other accounts without getting banned or restrictions before using the app. 

The app and its creator are not responsible for any consequence that may affect your posts, stories, content, account, platform, device, website, yourself or any other person or business 
after using the the app. I cannot guarantee that you will get followers.
